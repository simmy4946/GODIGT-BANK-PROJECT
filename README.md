A bank can generate revenue in a variety of ways, such as charging interest,
transaction fees and financial advice. Interest charged on the capital that the bank
lends out to customers has historically been the most significant method of revenue
generation. The bank earns profits from the difference between the interest rates it
pays on deposits and other sources of funds, and the interest rates it charges on the
loans it gives out.
GODIGT Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products,
such as savings accounts, current accounts, investment products, etc. among other
offerings. The bank also cross-sells asset products to its existing customers through
personal loans, auto loans, business loans, etc., and to do so they use various
communication methods including cold calling, e-mails, recommendations on the net
banking, mobile banking, etc.
GODIGT Bank also has a set of customers who were given credit cards based on risk
policy and customer category class but due to huge competition in the credit card
market, the bank is observing high attrition in credit card spending. The bank makes
money only if customers spend more on credit cards. Given the attrition, the Bank
wants to revisit its credit card policy and make sure that the card given to the customer
is the right credit card. The bank will make a profit only through the customers that
show higher intent towards a recommended credit card. (Higher intent means
consumers would want to use the card and hence not be attrite.)
